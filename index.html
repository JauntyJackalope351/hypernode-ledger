        <h1>Hypernode, a free decentralized ledger</h1>

<p>This project aims to create a distributed ledger with the goal of illustrating the Hypernode validation algorithm.<br>
It is a Proof of Stake system that supports delegation, can scale well, requires little power,supports multiple signing
algorithms(tested with RSA and ML-DSA-87),can relay messages and has a built-in voting system to update its own ledger parameters.</p><p>
It was written from scratch in Java using the Spring framework, as it is a very easy language to read, understand and validate.
One of the reason for the creation of this program was that the Bitcoin code was not intuitive to read or easy to deploy,
so auditability and ease of startup were important objectives of this project.</p><p>
Ease of use and security were considered, as you need both a signature from the user (like chip and pin)
and from your validator node (which acts like a sort of bank), so that incidents like MtGox cannot happen anymore.
You then get the ease of use of having normal people operate thin clients while the validator nodes do the heavy lifting,
but at the same time a motivated user has the option to run his own validator node.<br>
The power and computation were also a concern, especially as that GPU power could now be allocated to AI.
Another reason I was not fully happy with Bitcoin was the lack of an internal formal voting system, and the inability to
issue new currency without recurring to an hard fork.</p><p>
Since the delegated validator nodes vote to manage monetary policy this is, in fact, a democratic instrument.
If you so desire you do not even need the Internet to run this kind of ledger, you could run one entirely via avian carriers,
therefore becoming an important asset for communities that can't or won't connect to the mainstream Internet. </p>
